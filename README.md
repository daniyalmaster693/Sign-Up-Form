<h2> What have I learned </h2>

<li> I've learned how to create an error handling system using Javascript </li>
<li> I've learned how to use CSS custom properties </li>
<li> I've further built upon my responsive design skills </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating my HTML elements and assigning classes. Next, I moved onto the CSS, where I imported my fonts, and began with things like removing default properties, and defining custom properties for things like colors and transitions. I spent some time adding background colors, fonts styles, images and padding and margin. Then, I began working on the Js. I started my ensuring the dom was loaded in, to ensure event listeners would work. I declared the nesscary variables for buttons and things needed. I created my display errors function which would be used to call other functions and work with the sign up, sign in, and reset buttons. I spent time utilizing things like adding and removing class lists, to show and hide errors, and change the border of inputs. Next, I worked on creating a system for defining for when and what error to show. I created a function called email requirements (). I used things like text content, which allowed me to edit the text in the error based on what was causing it. This allowed me to do things like allow the user to enter an email, and recieve errors if they don't include and "@" symbol or ".com". Next, I created a function called passwordRequirements () which displays an error if the input is empty or the password has a length less then 4 characters. Throughout this project, I utilized properties such as opacity and position relative, to position element and add functionality. Finally, I spent some time testing the website on multiple browsers, ensured the Javascript was working correctly and used the bulit in device emulation feature to view how the form would look on different displays. </p>
